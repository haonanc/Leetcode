We are strongly committed to protecting your privacy. The information we collect about you is used only to process orders and personalize your shopping experience.
When you order from Musicnotes.com, we need your name, address, e-mail address, credit card number, and credit card expiration date in order to charge for and deliver your selections. Your credit card information is encrypted during processing and is only retained on our server if you specifically request we do so. All customer information is stored in a secured database, only accessible to employees with access rights to this information
We log all our web site's traffic, including pages visited, web browser used and originating IP address. We keep these logs on a separate, secure system, with access restricted to our system administrators. We use this information for troubleshooting and support. For instance, if you report a problem, we may search our logs to diagnose what happened to you.
We also save what searches our shoppers perform, but we do not save which customer did each search. We use this information in aggregate for internal marketing research.
