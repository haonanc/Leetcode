4.  Specific Prohibited Uses.
Faith It respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask Users to do the same.
The Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under US copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that Content hosted by the Services infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Faith It a notice requesting that the content or Material be removed, or access to it blocked.  The notice must include the following information:  (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Faith It to locate the content or material within the Services; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available ) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the content or material in a manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.  Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirement imposed by the DMCA; see www.loc.gov/copyright for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Service should be sent to
