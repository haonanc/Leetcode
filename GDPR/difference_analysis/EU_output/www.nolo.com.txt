Testimonials
By communicating positive comments to Nolo regarding Nolo's products and services you consent to allow Nolo to use those comments in whole or in part in Nolo's promotional materials as well as third-party materials promoting Nolo products. Nolo shall never use your full name, only your initials and location, when identifying the source of the comments.
Order Confirmation Emails
After placing an order, a customer will receive a confirmation email with their shipping address and order details, including an order number.
Infrequent Email Communications
Nolo.com will from time to time deliver email offers to customers who have opted to allow us to communicate with them, though not all are subscribers to Nolo's email newsletters or to Nolo's Legal Updater. Customers who ask to no longer receive such offers are marked as "Do Not Deliver" in our database.
Finally, if there's ever a major error included in a Nolo email that provides misleading information or misstates the nature of an offer, Nolo will send a corrected version of the email, accompanied with an explanation of the problem.
