This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use and Terms of Service . Each time that you access or use the Site or our Services, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use, the Terms of Service, and this Privacy Policy.

I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information Provided by You.
Registration and Membership. We will collect personal information from you when you visit our Site, sign up for our Services, interact with our Site, register with us, or use various features of our Site. In order to register on our Site, you must first complete the registration form providing contact information (such as name, email, and address). To become a member, you must also provide billing information (such as credit and/or debit card account information). This information is used for enrollment and billing purposes; to verify customer membership; and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information may be used to contact you. When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise register for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product, or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you regarding future information about our Services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you with information regarding your membership, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving. We may also use any information that you provide to us to inform you of other company products and services, including reaching out to you if you started but did not complete a product registration process. 
Surveys and Sweepstakes. From time to time, we may request information from users or members via surveys or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys or sweepstakes is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Contact information may be used to notify the winners, award prizes, and file winners as required by law. Survey information will be used for purpose of the survey, including for the monitoring or improvement of the use and satisfaction of the Site.
Information Collected About Your Use of the Site and Services.
Web Logs. Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends, and administer the Site. We may track your movement within the Site and through our offers on affiliate websites, the pages from which you were referred, access times, and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness of our Site, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.
Cookies. To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site and advertisements on affiliate sites use data "cookies." We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use persistent cookies to differentiate visitors to our Site from registered users and members, to customize the content of certain sections of the Site, and to enable us to track and cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the Site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Cookies help us learn which areas of our Site are useful and which areas need improvement. You may configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site may be limited, and you may not be able to use certain features of the Site.
Web Beacons. Our web pages contain "web beacons." Web beacons allow us to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect other types of aggregate information. Using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Sites are the most interesting, and what kind of offers our registered users like to see. Some of the web beacons that are in place on our Site are used only by us, and other web beacons are from our affiliates, vendors, and advertisers, which use this data to assist us in analyzing how our offers and Site are accessed and used.
Supplemental Information. We may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your address, payment card, or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to enable us to fulfill our products and services, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services, and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes. In the event that additional information is requested from a member to support a claim made under a specific benefit provided, we will use this information to validate the nature of the claim. This may include contacting the retailer where a purchase was made to verify that an item was purchased, the amount paid, if a benefit was utilized, or if an item has been returned.
II. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
Service Providers. We may use third-party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending emails, processing and approving orders, order fulfillment, sweepstakes administration, and state filings. We may share your personal and account information with these third parties for those limited purposes.
Strategic Partners. We have entered into agreements with third-party-affiliated companies to enable us to provide our Services in connection with sales our members have made with those companies, such as shipping fees charged by those companies. In certain situations, we may provide your information to those companies informing them of your membership or to investigate a claim or inquiry regarding any benefit you may make pertaining to our Services and your interactions with those companies. Since these third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their websites for information regarding their privacy policies.
Other Uses: We may use your personal information to contact you about the Services on our Site for which you have expressed an interest; for example, if you have contacted customer service or made an inquiry. We may also use information you provide to us, such as your email address, when you start, but do not finish, the registration process for the Services. 
Announcements. We may send you service-related announcements and emails from time to time relating to your account. These include emails such as order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, and payment-card problem notifications. We may also send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if any service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, the delivery of a service is delayed, or if there is some service issue with something you might have requested, we might send you a notice. You may not opt out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
Legal Matters; Safety. We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms and Conditions, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.
Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets. In the event that we, or any of our businesses, are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets, or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal and non-personal information of our visitors and registered users and members may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our visitors may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, support, or funding. In such transactions, personal information will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained.

V. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES, AND CONTACT INFORMATION
Links to other sites. To the extent that hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third-party sites, or if you come to our Site through a link from any such third-party sites, you should be aware that these external or third-party sites are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of these sites to determine how your personal information will be utilized by the proprietors of those third-party sites.
Security. It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you or received from a partner. We use a variety of current technologies and processes intended to protect our customer data. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities. It is our practice to use encryption whenever we receive or transmit sensitive data.
When you enter credit card information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using Secure Sockets Layer technology (SSL). You can easily determine when you're sending data securely by looking at the Web address (URL) in your browser window: The first few letters will change from "http" to "https" when you are transmitting information protected by SSL encryption (the "s" in "https" stands for "secure").
However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guarantee that there will never be unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information, and your use of the Site indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.
A Note To International Users. The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site from outside the United States, by providing your information to the Site, you are consenting to the transfer of your information to the United States for processing and maintenance in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions.

If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal information, you will know because the Effective Date of the Privacy Policy will change. If we are going to use any personal information in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the change. If you do not consent, your personal information will be used as agreed to under the terms of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we obtained that information.
