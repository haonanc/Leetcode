A Central Source for Information about SSAâ€™s Privacy Compliance Program
SSA's Commitment to Protecting Privacy through Compliance
We have a long history of collecting information to carry out our mission. Chances are, you either receive Social Security benefits, or know someone who does.  We are passionate about supporting our customers by delivering financial support, providing superior customer service, and ensuring the privacy and security of your information. The first regulation we published included a commitment to the public to safeguard the personal information you entrust to us. Our commitment is as solid now as it was when Social Security began in 1935, and we include the highest level of privacy protections possible.
