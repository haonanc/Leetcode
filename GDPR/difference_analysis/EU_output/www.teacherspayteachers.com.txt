Your privacy and security are very important to us at Teachers Pay Teachers. We’re committed to transparency when it comes to our privacy practices and how we safeguard your information.

This is information that can be used to identify you personally and includes things like your full name, your street address, your phone number, and your email address. Other than as provided for in this Policy, we won’t share or disclose this kind of information unless we get your permission. Other information that we collect may not identify you personally.

B. PURCHASE INFORMATION
When you make a purchase through our Services, you’ll need to provide billing and payment information to complete your order.

You have the option to save a credit or debit card record with our Payment Processor to re-use those details for future purchases on TpT without having to re-enter them at checkout. You can edit or remove this information at any time by navigating to the checkout page or by contacting us for assistance.
