Experian® considers itself a steward of the information it collects, maintains                      and utilizes. Our responsibility is to ensure the security of the information in our                      care and to maintain the privacy of consumers through appropriate, responsible use.
We provide services based on information about millions of individuals and                      businesses. Use of that information is guided by our Global                      Information Values .
These Information Values form the foundation for Experian's                      belief that information use must benefit both businesses and individuals while meeting                      consumers' privacy expectations.
Information policies, built on our values,                      more specifically define how information may be used. The policies vary to meet the                      legal requirements and consumer expectations in the area in which the information                      product or service is being used.
Underlying these policies is Experian's commitment                      to provide consumers notice, choice and education about the use of personal information.                      Educated consumers are better equipped to be effective, successful participants in                      a world that increasingly relies on the exchange of information to efficiently deliver                      the products and services consumers demand.
Today, our business clients' needs                      and consumers' expectations are constantly changing, and technology is constantly                      evolving. Our approach to privacy, rooted in these Global Information Values, enables                      Experian to respond to those constantly changing needs and expectations and provides the flexibility to implement new processes and policies to resolve information issues                      in this dynamic environment.
