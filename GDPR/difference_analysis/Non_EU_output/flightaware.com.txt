What this policy covers
This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our products or services. This policy also explains your choices about how we use information about you. Your choices include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you. If you do not agree with this policy, then do not access or use our services or interact with any other aspect of our business.
What information we collect about you and how we use it
When you register for FlightAware and other FlightAware services, we ask you for your name, contact information, preferences, and personal profile information. This information lets us provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. We also use aggregated information about the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences and improve our products.
Like most web sites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us remember information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our service without reintroducing yourself. Web browsers let you easily see and control cookies. FlightAware and its advertisers may also use cookies to determine on which advertisements users have seen and how users responded to them. Similarly, FlightAware and its advertisers may use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous advertising metrics and to deliver cookies related to such advertisements.

Sharing with third parties
We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our products.

How we store and secure information we collect
Information storage and security
We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
How long we keep information
How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
Account information: We retain your account information until you delete your account. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our products. Where we retain information for product improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our products, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.
Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, then we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information.
How to access and control your information
You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations. We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.
Your Choices
You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information, or to request the deletion or restriction of your information. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the products and using features available in your account. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the "Contact Us" section below.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
Access and update your information: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the product. For example, you can update your account information within your account settings and modify content that contains information about you.
Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a product account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is a delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved.
Opt out of communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each e-mail or by updating your e-mail preferences within the account profile settings. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our products. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.
