Signing Rules
When you use Bing services with a web browser, we will place one or more "cookies" on your machine. For example, Bing uses a cookie with a unique identifier known as the Search ID to operate the service and enable certain search features. If you sign into Bing or other Microsoft services using a Microsoft account, we will set or read one or more additional cookies. We use these cookies to operate Bing services and provide you a more relevant search experience. You can use your browser settings to remove or block cookies on your computer.
We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information.

Please see below for more information about cookies and how to control them.
Our Use of Cookies
Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801
We may use cookies for:
Storing your Preferences and Settings. If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.
Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.
Targeted Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages you visit on Microsoft and other sites, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement .
Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.
Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the reasons we typically set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:
Cookie name
Description
MUID
Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes. .
ANON
Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user’s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.
CC
Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup.
Microsoft account authentication
NAP
Contains an encrypted version of the user’s country, ZIP code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user’s Windows Live profile.
MH
Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.
ACH01
Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.
TOptOut
Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.
In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.
How to Control Cookies
Browser Controls to Block Cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps:
Click “Tools” and then select “Internet Options”
Click the “Privacy” tab at the top of the window
Move the slider up or down to select the types of cookies you wish to block
Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available (in English) at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/
Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
Browser Controls to Delete Cookies
. If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps:
Click “Tools” and then select “Internet Options”
On the “General” tab, under “Browsing History,” click the “Delete” button
On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies”
Click the “Delete” button
Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available (in English) at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ .
Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.
Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices. Microsoft does not currently respond to the DNT signal but work is underway to enable that capability in the future.
Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. Additionally, in Internet Explorer 10 you may switch DNT "off" or "on" independently, if you'd like.  For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help.
Advertising Opt-Out Controls. Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use at Your privacy and Microsoft personalized ads. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users’ privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:   
Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft’s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at Your privacy and Microsoft personalized ads. Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from being collected.
Our Use of Web Beacons
Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
We may also work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.
Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. We prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information. Nevertheless, you may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by clicking the links for each of the following analytics providers:
Other Similar Technologies
In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or “Flash cookies”) and Silverlight Application Storage.
Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies.” Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies” to store data on your computer. Note that the ability to clear Flash cookies may or may not be controlled by your browser setting for standard cookies as that may vary by browser. To manage or block Flash cookies, go to http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html
Silverlight Application Storage. Web sites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, visit the Silverlight Privacy Statement
When you use Bing services, Microsoft may collect many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can. We collect information when you register, sign in and use our sites and services. We also may get information from other companies. We collect this information in a variety of ways, including from web forms, technologies like cookies, web logging and software on your computer or other device.
When you conduct a search, Microsoft collects the following:
Search term and time and date of your search
IP address, browser configuration and approximate location
Any unique identifiers contained in the cookies
We store search terms (and the cookie IDs associated with search terms) separately from any account information that directly identifies the user, such as name, e-mail address, or phone numbers. We have technological safeguards in place designed to prevent the unauthorized correlation of this data and we remove the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, cookies and other cross session identifiers, after 18 months.
Bing provides search services to select partners and its users. Some examples include Yahoo! and Nokia. In order to provide these services, Bing services receive certain search related information from these partners that may include date, time, IP address, a unique identifier and other search related data.
Microsoft collects many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can. Some of this information you provide directly to us. Some of it we get by observing how you interact with our products and services. Some of it is available from other sources that we may combine with the data we collect directly. Regardless of the source, we believe it’s important to treat that information with care and to help you maintain your privacy.
What we collect:
Search. When you conduct a search, Microsoft will collect the search terms you provide, along with your IP address, the unique identifiers contained in the cookies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. We will attempt to derive your approximate location based on your IP address, and will use that information to display search results tailored to your geographic location. When using a web browser, you may be able to change your default location, such as via an “Options” link on the search page, and your location and other search settings are stored in a cookie on your machine. If you are using a mobile device and have allowed Bing Search services to use your current location, we will also collect your approximate latitude and longitude. For information on turning off location-based search services in Windows 8 applications, see the  Bing Applications  section of this privacy statement.
Registration. When you sign up to use our sites or services you may be required to provide information about yourself, such as your name, birthdate and postal code.
Signing in. To access some Microsoft services, you will need to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your Microsoft account. If you access our services via a mobile phone, you may also use your telephone number and a PIN as an alternative credential to your username and password. By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically signed into other Microsoft sites and services that use the Microsoft account.  Click here for more Microsoft account privacy information.
Using our sites, applications and services. We collect information that tells us how you interact with our applications or services, including the browser you’re using, your IP address, location, cookies or other unique IDs, the pages you visit and features you use.
Data from other sources. We may get additional information about you, such as demographic data we purchase from other companies. As discussed in the Facebook Personalization section below, we may also obtain certain information from Facebook to enable personalization features.
Search Services for Yahoo!. Bing provides search services to Yahoo! and its users. In order to provide these services, Bing receives certain search related information from Yahoo!. This information includes date, time, IP Address, a unique identifier and other search related data. When we receive a search query and the related information from Yahoo!, we treat it in accordance with Yahoo!’s retention and de-identification practice which includes the full deletion of the IP Address from most log files at ninety days. Information provided as part of the search services is used to help select the advertising you see within the search experience.
How we collect:
We use a number of methods and technologies to gather information about how you use our sites and services, such as:
Web forms, such as when you type information into a registration form or type a search query into a search box.
Technologies like cookies and web beacons (please visit the cookie section of this privacy statement to learn more about these technologies).
Web logging, which enables us to collect the standard information your browser or application sends to every web site you visit – such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the URL of the site you came from – as well as the pages you visit and the links you click while using our sites and services.
Software installed on your computer or other devices, which may send back information needed to operate, update or improve that software.
Storage and Retention:
We store search terms (and the cookie IDs associated with search terms) separately from any account information that directly identifies the user, such as name, e-mail address, or phone numbers. Further, we have built-in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent the unauthorized correlation of this data. We take additional steps to protect the privacy of stored search information by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, cookies and other cross session identifiers, after 18 months.
Microsoft uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer. We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account and security updates.
For Bing services, we use this information to provide you with relevant search results. We also use the information we collect to maintain and improve the quality, security and integrity of our services. For example we may use this information for research purposes and to improve the relevancy of Bing search results. This information is also necessary in order to detect and protect against security threats such as botnet attacks, click fraud, worms, and other threats.
Finally, as described in the Display of Advertising section of this document, we may use search query data for the purpose of personalizing the ads we display to you as you use our services or those of our advertising partners.
How we use your personal information.
Microsoft uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer. Information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information collected through other Microsoft services to give you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with us. We may also supplement this with information from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies to help us derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.
For Bing services, we use this information to provide you with relevant search results. We also use the information we collect to maintain and improve the quality, security and integrity of our services. For example we may use this information for research purposes and to improve the relevancy of search results. This information is also necessary in order to detect and protect against security threats such as botnet attacks, click fraud, worms, and other threats.
We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you when a subscription is ending, letting you know when security updates are available or letting you know when you need to take action to keep your account active.
Microsoft provides many of our sites and services free of charge because they are supported by advertising. In order to make these services widely available, the information we collect may be used to help improve the advertisements you see by making them more relevant to you. For example, we may use search query data for the purpose of personalizing the ads we display to you as you use our services or those of our advertising partners. The search terms you enter in Bing are categorized and certain user segments are inferred based on those terms. For example, if you search on terms associated with sports, we may associate a “sports segment” with the unique identifier contained in your cookie, and you will then be more likely to see ads related to sports.
Except as described in this privacy statement, we won’t disclose your personal information to a third party without your consent.
We may share some anonymized search query data with selected third parties for research purposes.
When you click on a link from a Bing search results page, the destination website will receive the standard information your browser sends to every web site you visit, including the URL of the site you came from.  Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered, the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered.
If your browser is enabled to allow pages to pre-load in the background for faster performance, Bing may use this functionality and your browser may preload page(s) in the background for faster results.  When your browser loads a page in the background, it will have the same effect as if you visited that page, including sending the Bing results page URL (which may contain your search query) and downloading any cookie files that page may set.  You can delete cookies using your browser settings.  Click  here for more information on how to delete cookies and to control pre-loading pages in Internet Explorer 11.
Please see Other Important Privacy Information for additional details about when we may disclose information, including with Microsoft affiliates and vendors; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to combat fraud or protect our interest; or to protect lives.
Except as described in this privacy statement, we won’t disclose your personal information to a third party without your consent.
We may share some anonymized search query data with selected third parties for research purposes. Before we do so, we remove all unique identifiers such as IP addresses and cookie IDs from the data. We also run the data through a process designed to remove identifiable information that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for any other purposes.
When you click on a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page, the destination website will receive the standard information your browser sends to every web site you visit – such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the URL of the site you came from (in this case, the Bing search results page).  Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered (which could include names, addresses, or other identifying information you entered), the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered. 
If your browser is enabled to allow pages to pre-load in the background for faster performance, Bing may use this functionality and your browser may preload page(s) in the background for faster results.  When your browser loads a page in the background, it will have the same effect as if you visited that page, including sending the Bing results page URL (which may contain your search query) and downloading any cookie files that page may set.  You can delete cookies using your browser settings.  Click  here for more information on how to delete cookies and to control pre-loading pages in Internet Explorer 11.

If you have agreed to allow access to your location, we collect the following information to improve your search and mapping results, provide you deals for local businesses, and operate and improve our services:
Bing Search services and Bing Mobile applications: The approximate location of your device will be sent to Microsoft along with search terms, time and date of your search and a unique identifier generated by the application. Refer to the documentation that came with your device for information about how to turn off location for an application.
"Check In” and “Reminders”: When you sign into these services, Microsoft stores the approximate location of your device along with your Microsoft account. To disable access to your device’s location by these services, go to the settings menu of the Bing Search application and turn location to “Off.” If you are using a browser to access Bing Search services, refer to the browser documentation to disable sharing your location for sites visited on that browser.
Mapping features: Features on Microsoft's sites and services are based in part on the Bing Maps service. When you submit information, such as an address to be viewed on a map, to the application, that application passes it to Bing Maps for processing.
If you’ve allowed a Bing mobile application to access your location, when you conduct a search, the approximate location of your device will be sent to Microsoft along with the search terms, time and date of your search and a unique identifier generated by the application. This information will be used to provide and improve search and mapping results.Refer to the documentation that came with your device for information about how to turn off location for a Bing Search application. If you turn off or disable location for the Bing Search application or the browser that you use to go to m.bing.com, you will stop sharing your device's location with Bing. When you sign into and use the location-based services, “Check-in” and “Reminders”, Microsoft stores the approximate location of your device along with your Microsoft account. The location information is used to provide relevant search results, offer you deals for local businesses, and operate and improve our services. To disable access to your device’s location by these services, go to the settings menu of the Bing application and turn location to “Off.” Binglets integrate third party services into Bing search that enable you to associate an action with your search results. For example, if you search on restaurants, a Binglet provides the functionality to enable you to reserve a table. When you use a third party “Binglet” within a Bing application, information you provide to the Binglet is shared with the third party named in it. For details about the third party’s information collection and usage practices, see the privacy policy on their web site. Bing doesn’t separately collect or store information provided to a third party Binglet. Mapping features on Microsoft's sites and services are based in part on the Bing Maps service. Bing Maps is a set of mapping and related services that can be accessed through an application such as a Web site, desktop software, or mobile application. When you submit information, such as an address to be viewed on a map, to the application, that application passes it to Bing Maps for processing. We keep track of all requests the application you are using makes to the Bing Maps Service. Location-related information in the request or derived from the request, may be used for calculating payments to our data vendors so that we may operate the service. We will occasionally capture all information in the request for use in testing and maintenance of the service. This information includes the date and time of the request and location-related information you may have provided to the application such as latitude and longitude, address, place name or the start and end address of a route.
Bing uses Facebook Instant Personalization to provide a more relevant and useful search experience for Facebook users using your public information from Facebook. Facebook Instant Personalization is a program in which websites can check to see if you are actively logged into Facebook, and provide you with an enhanced experience that takes your Facebook social network into account, as permitted by your Facebook privacy settings. You can turn off these Instant Personalization features at any time by going to http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=204873389548151 .
 In addition, Bing search and Microsoft apps that use Bing services (also known as “Bing apps”) described in the  Bing Apps  section of this statement may also have features available that permit you to connect to Facebook to further personalize your experience on Bing search and to personalize your experience in Bing apps.  You can turn off these additional personalization features by going to https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications and removing the Bing app.

When you type a query in a Bing app, that information will be sent to Microsoft to provide you with the search results you are requesting. We use and protect this information as described in the  Collecting Your Information section of this statement.
For the Autosuggest feature, the characters that you type into a Bing search will be sent to Microsoft in order to provide you with real-time Search Suggestions.
Bing Experience Improvement Program for Bing Toolbar and Bing Desktop
If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional information about how you use these specific Bing apps, including information about your searches within these apps. Additionally, when you opt into the Bing Experience program on Bing Toolbar, we collect information about the addresses of the websites you visit to help improve search ranking and relevance.  The information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program helps us to improve the quality and performance of our products and services.
To help protect your privacy, we do not use any of the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you, or target advertising to you.  Also, we take steps to store such information separately from any account information we may have that directly identifies you, such as name, e-mail address, or phone numbers. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after eighteen months. You may stop participating in the Bing Experience Improvement Program by following the instructions here .
Configuring Bing apps to use other data sources:
Some Bing apps provide you the option to configure the application to use additional information from other Microsoft products and services, or from third parties. For example:
Your Facebook information, if Facebook personalization is enabled, for use in apps that use social features (such as Local Scout in Maps). See the Facebook section for more details.
Your HealthVault information that you consent to use in certain apps such as the Bing Health and Fitness app. Bing only displays this information and does not store it.
Your personal finance information from third party financial institutions that you consent to use in the Finance app. Bing only displays this information and does not store it with any of your search information.  Your login credentials used to access your financial information from third parties are encrypted on your PC and are not sent to Microsoft.
Information from other companies that you have configured for use such as travel itineraries in the Travel app and subscriptions in the News app.  
Personalization and Syncing for apps
If you want to enhance your experience when using some Bing apps, you can choose to “personalize” and/or “sync” your apps and other Microsoft services. Personalization provides you with a customized experience to provide features that are most relevant to you and your interests. Syncing allows any settings or customizations to be used across all devices for that application.  These features use information collected by your Bing app (as described in the “Collecting your Information” and “Using your Information” sections above) and information associated with your Microsoft account. If you are signed in to Windows or Windows Phone with a Microsoft account (or a domain account connected to a Microsoft account), the personalization features will be enabled by default. You may have different personalization and sync settings depending on the version of your Bing app as noted below.
Other Bing apps on non-Microsoft devices, such as older iOS versions of the Bing app, do not offer personalization or syncing because they do not have functionality to allow you to use your Microsoft account to sign in or sign out of the app. 
All information used for personalization and syncing are stored on Microsoft servers and for security purposes are transmitted using SSL. Some information used to customize your apps on a specific PC will not be synced on that PC and your devices until you add that PC to your Microsoft account as a trusted PC.
Personalization and syncing for Windows 8.1 versions of Bing apps
If you are using an 8.1 version of a Bing app the following features will be enabled by default:
Personalization:  When personalization is enabled, Microsoft will use information collected from the app and information associated with your Microsoft account to personalize content provided to you in the app and to personalize other Microsoft services. For example, if you configure the Weather app to show weather for Seattle, the Travel app may give you recommendations for events in Seattle. 
Sync across devices:  When “Sync across devices” is enabled, Microsoft will use information that is used to customize your app, such as your favorite sports team in the Sports app or your preference for metric units, across all your devices.
For all of the Bing apps except Maps, the settings for these features can be changed using the Personalization option in the app Settings charm.  For the Maps app, you can turn personalization and syncing on or off by disconnecting your Microsoft account or other accounts using the Accounts options of the app Settings charm.
Syncing for older versions of Bing apps and Bing apps
Older versions of Bing apps for Windows do not offer personalization and rely on the Sync Your Settings option in PC settings to determine whether to sync your customized app settings.  If you do not want to sync your customized app settings, you can turn off this functionality in PC settings -> Sync your settings.  You can also turn off syncing by not signing in to Windows with a Microsoft account (or a domain account connected to a Microsoft account).
Syncing for Windows phone and other operating systems
For Bing apps on your Windows Phone, personalization and syncing can be turned on and off by signing in or out of your Microsoft account.  For example, in certain versions of Bing apps for Windows Phone, you can sign in or out of the app in Settings-> Personalization.
For the Bing app on your iOS device, personalization and syncing can be turned on and off by signing in or out of your Microsoft account.
Personalized ads on Windows Bing apps
The Settings charm also has a Microsoft Advertising option that allows you to enable or disable the use of your information collected from Bing apps for the purpose of personalized advertising.
Letting Bing apps use location in Windows
If you consent to send location information to an app, that information will be used to provide the service you’ve requested, as well as to improve our products and services. You can stop sending location information either through the Windows privacy setting or through the specific app settings, depending on your Windows version or device. For example, on Windows 8.1 you have the option to update this both in the Windows privacy menu, or using the app’s setting charm.

Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners.
Creating a Microsoft account.
You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other “account proofs,” such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your “account proofs” for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your “credentials” that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.
When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code.We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law. In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information. In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number). If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting Your privacy and Microsoft personalized ads  so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads. For more information about how Microsoft uses information for advertising, please see the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement.
You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.
Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account. This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners. Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications.
If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.
Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.
When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.
Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.
If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password,view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.
Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested. All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each site you sign into in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.
Accessing your personal information.
You can access your personal information by going to account. You can change your user name if your Microsoft account does not belong to a managed domain. You can always change your password, alternate email address, phone number, and question and secret answer. You may also close your Microsoft account by going to account, and then “Close your account.” If your account is in a managed domain, as described above, there may be a special process for closing your account. Please note that if you are an MSN or a Windows Live user, if you go to account, you may be redirected to account for those sites.
