Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies
“Cookies” are unique identifiers that we may place on your computer’s browser or your device so that our systems can recognize your device, to store your preferences, to provide personalized advertisements and for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Service or with other websites or services. Patch may also use Flash cookies, or locally shared objects (“LSOs”), that operate similarly to browser cookies. Patch, or its Partners, may also use “web beacons,” clear GIFs or similar technologies, pieces of information placed on a service or email to track and collect information about user behavior, for example by counting the number of visitors to a web page, delivering a cookie to a user’s browser or tracking open rates, clicks and forwards.
Patch, or its Partners, may use cookies and similar technologies to customize your visit to or use of the Service, or to help us to enhance or improve the Service, for example by storing your password or delivering relevant advertising to you when you use the Service. We may also work with our Partners to use such technologies to help them provide advertisements to you when you visit other websites or applications, and to research and analyze how the Service is used, and user response to and interaction with advertisements.
Patch may work with our Partners to synchronize unique, non-personally identifiable identifiers in order to match our identifiers with those used by our Partners. These companies may collect and use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to or use of the Service and other websites and apps. The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by such Partners and advertisers is not in Patch’s control and is subject to the privacy policies of such third parties.
By accessing or using the Service, you consent to Patch and its Partners using the cookies and other technologies described in this Privacy Policy, and similar technologies that may be developed in the future, to track your activities and use of the Service, including in emails we may send to you.
You may be able to set your browser to disable cookies or LSOs, or to refuse certain types of cookies or warn you before accepting cookies. LSOs using Adobe Flash can be managed using Flash management tools on the Adobe website. However, doing so may mean that certain parts of the Service may not work for you. Some Partners may use technologies other than cookies to recognize your computer or device or to collect information about your use of the Service or other websites or services, and you may not be able to block use of such technologies.  Some browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to websites and online services. Patch does not currently take any action or respond to such signals.
Patch or its Partners may use mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) to collect information, such as your IDFA or Android Advertising ID, and other information about how your device interacts with the Service. SDKs allow app developers to enable advertising, collection of data and related services and analytics in apps. Patch may use this technology to deliver, or to help Partners deliver, advertising through the Apps and other mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your device. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your device’s advertising identifier by accessing the privacy settings.
Third Parties
Patch Partners may use cookies, web beacons, widgets, SDKs, IP addresses and similar technologies when you access or use the Service or see advertisements provided through the Service to provide you with advertising that is relevant to you, for analytics purposes (for example to determine whether you later purchased a product or service in an advertisement you clicked on or took some other action), to provide content from a content provider’s server and to offer content or services based on the content of the pages you visit or other criteria. In some cases, because you must request content from the Partner’s server or otherwise communicate directly with the Partner’s server, the Partner can collect your information, such as your IP address or browser information, as if you had visited their website or used their app directly.  In connection with the foregoing, Patch Partners may collect information about the content or ads you viewed, how long you spent on different pages or parts of the Service, how you arrived at specific pages on the Service, and how you responded to ads that you saw.  Partners may also collect information about other apps on your devices, the websites you visit, your location and other information.  Patch may also allow certain Partners, such as third-party ad servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and providers of sponsored content to serve advertisements and collect information within the Service.
Some of the Partners that may use cookies and similar technologies on the Service for such purposes are listed below. We may update this list from time to time, so please review this Privacy Policy periodically.
