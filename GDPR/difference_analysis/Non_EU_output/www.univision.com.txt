Notice To California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights:
Effective January 1, 2005, under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the "Shine the Light" law), if an individual who is a California resident has provided personal information to a business in connection with a business relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and if that business has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such an individual's personal information to a third-party and knows or should have known that such third-party used the information for its own direct marketing purposes, then that business is obligated to disclose in writing to such individual upon request, what personal information was shared and with whom it was shared. A business may comply with this law by: (1) having EITHER a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information for third-parties' direct marketing use unless the customer has first affirmatively opted in to such sharing OR a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information for third-parties' direct marketing use if the customer has opted out to prevent his/her personal information from being shared for direct marketing use; AND (2) notifying the customer of his/her right to opt out and providing a cost-free means for the customer to exercise that right.
Any request for a disclosure required under this law should be sent to us via email at  caprivacy@correo.univision.com . Please note that under this law, we are not required to respond to a customer's request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any request that is not sent to the email address designated above.
California residents may also learn how Univision responds to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. As the technology is evolving for recognizing and interpreting DNT signals, and no uniform standard has yet been set, Univision is not currently responding to DNT signals but remains open to following the technological standards once those are issued.
1. Types of Information We Collect
Personally Identifiable Information (or "PII") is any information that can identify or is linked to a specific individual, such as your name, mailing address, telephone number (including mobile number), email address, credit card number, debit card number, bank account number, and other financial account information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, demographic, location and household information, etc. To the extent you voluntarily provide your PII to us, we collect such information. For example, we may collect PII from you (to the extent permitted by law): (1) when you sign up for one of our products or services, such as when you join one of our online communities (including the social networking areas on Univision.com and our fan pages on third-party social media sites); (2) when you join one of our mailing or contact lists; (3) when you register to participate in an event sponsored by us (such as a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, promotion, survey, concert, festival, community fair, etc.); (4) when you enter into a transaction with us, such as ordering a product from us through our online store; (5) when you use or interact with a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network; (6) when you provide or share information using a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network; (7) when you send information via message, chat, blog, post or similar functionality using a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network; (8) when you create, share or link personal profile using a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network, including linking or associating your profile on a third-party site or platform with your Univision account; and/or (9) when you submit a request or inquiry to us via the Univision Interactive Network or otherwise (each of the foregoing is referred to hereinafter as an"Identification Activity").
It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. However, if you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, we may ask you for certain PII. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some may be identified as optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity that requires it, you will not be able to engage in that activity. In addition, if you use the Univision Interactive Network to send information to another person (e.g., a friend, a family member, etc.), we will also collect PII of that other person to the extent disclosed by you. We also collect the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from, for example, and will only use it for that purpose.
Aggregate and Anonymous Information (hereinafter "AAI") is any information that cannot identify or be linked to a specific individual. For example, we may collect anonymous group data (demographics, media habits, online browsing habits, interests and preferences, etc.) about viewers and listeners of our television and radio programs, participants of our sponsored events and activities, users and members of the Univision Interactive Network, etc. (hereinafter referred to collectively as "our Audiences"). We also collect aggregate traffic data pertaining to the Univision Interactive Network, such as: total page views in a given time period; total impressions per ad; average amount of time that visitors spend on the Univision Interactive Network (or a part thereof) each time they visit; average amount of time that visitors spend on each page of any one or more parts of the Univision Interactive Network; percentage of visitors from a certain geographical area, etc. Moreover, we may combine "User Activity Information" (as described below) about you and other users of the Univision Interactive Network to generate aggregate information that reflects activities, habits, preferences, interests, etc. about our users as a group. We also collect location-based information such as zip code, city and state name. In addition, we may take PII and make it non-personally identifiable, such as by aggregating your information with information about other individuals, or by removing personally-identifiable elements (such as names) so as to "anonymize" or "de-personalize" your information.
User Activity Information (hereinafter "UAI") refers to information we collect about user activities on the Univision Interactive Network. For example, our web servers automatically collect and log "clickstream data" for all visitors to Univision.com, such as IP addresses (which are numerical numbers that are automatically assigned to users' computers and mobile devices when they are surfing the Internet), page requests, pages visited, content viewed, clicks and search queries made, etc. We also use cookies and similar technologies to collect UAI on the Univision Interactive Network (see Section 5 below for more information). If and to the extent we use any UAI in a manner that identifies a specific user individually (e.g., if we link or associate such information with a user's name or address), it will be treated as PII. Otherwise, all UAI will be treated as AAI.
2. What We Do With the Information
As a general matter, we use information (PII and AAI) collected from and/or about our Audiences to improve our products and services so that they are appealing to as many people as possible, to administer and maintain operations of the Univision Interactive Network, to offer, market and advertise products and services (including those from third parties outside Univision with whom we do business (hereinafter referred to collectively as "our Business Partners")) to our Audiences, to administer and manage transactions and relationships with our Audiences, to personalize user experiences for our Audiences, and to build a strong community for our Audiences.
2.1 Our Own Use of Information
2.1.1 Transactional, Administrative, and Customer Relation Purposes: If you provide information to us in connection with an Identification Activity, we will process and use your information for all purposes related to that activity, including communicating and interacting with you in relation to your activity. For example: (1) if you sign up for a product or service of the Univision Interactive Network, we will use your information to set up, administer, service, and communicate with you regarding, your account; (2) if you register to enter one of our contests or sweepstakes, we will use your information to process your entry and to conduct and administer the contest or sweepstake (including communicating with you in the event you are selected as a winner); (3) if you join one of our mailing or contact lists, we will use your information to send you or contact you with information that you have requested or that may be of interest to you; and (4) if you order a product or service from us, we will use your information to process and fulfill your order, to communicate with you regarding the same, and to provide customer service to you. Also, if you provide your email address or mailing address to us, we may use such address to send you notices of a transactional, administrative or relationship nature or as required by law, such as notification of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for the Univision Interactive Network, notification of an actual or suspected security breach that affects your information stored by or for us, public relations announcements, etc.
2.1.2 Marketing & Advertising Purposes:
(1) Interest-based advertising on the Univision Interactive Network: We may use your PII and UAI to provide to you interest-based ads (i.e., ads potentially relevant or tailored to your interests) about products and services of Univision and/or our Business Partners. For example, we show ads inside and/or alongside the videos you watch on Univision.com. Sometimes, these ads are based on the topics or subject matters of the videos you are watching. However, to make these ads as relevant as possible for you, we may infer your viewing interests based on videos you have previously viewed on Univision.com, and may use this information to associate your browser with relevant interest categories and show you ads relevant to your inferred interests. For example, if your prior viewing habits on Univision.com suggest that you are a fan of a particular television show of Univision (e.g., if you often view video clips from that show on Univision.com), you may see more ads related to that show while on Univision.com. As another example, if you frequently view sports-related videos on Univision.com, we may associate a sports interest category with your browser and show you more sports-related ads when you are on Univision.com.
(2) Email marketing: If you provide your email address or mailing address to us (such as by joining one of our mailing lists), we may use such address to send you product and service offers, promotions, and advertisements from us and/or from our Business Partners. See Section 3.2 below regarding how to opt out of our email marketing.
(3) Telemarketing: If you provide your telephone or mobile number to us, we may call you to inform you about product/service offers, promotions, and advertisements from us and/or from our Business Partners. See Section 3.2 below regarding how to opt out of our telemarketing.
(4) Mobile marketing: Subject to your prior opt-in consent, we may (i) send marketing and advertising messages via SMS (Short Message Service), MMS (Multimedia Message Service), etc., to your mobile device and/or (ii) send marketing and advertising emails to your wireless email account (e.g., XYZ@att.mobile.net), to inform you about product/service offers, promotions, and advertisements from us and/or from our Business Partners. See Section 3.2 below regarding how to opt out of our mobile marketing (that is, if you wish to opt out of our further use of your information for mobile marketing after you have previously consented to such use).
NOTE: The Federal Communications Commission has published a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to transmit emails to wireless devices  here . Wireless service providers must add new domain names to this list within 30 days of activating them. If your email address contains a domain name on this list (after the "@" symbol), then we will treat your email address as a wireless email address. However, the mere fact that you can retrieve emails from your regular Internet email accounton your mobile/wireless device, does not make your Internet email address a "wireless" email address.
2.1.3. Market Research Purposes: We may use AAI (including UAI and AAI derived from PII) to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves as well as for our Business Partners.
2.2.1 Disclosure to our Business Partners: We may disclose, sell, and otherwise provide PII, AAI and/or UAI to our Business Partners so that they may market and advertise their products and services (including, without limitation, retail stores, finance, real estate, insurance, travel, automotive, telecommunications, technology, electronics, health, beauty, food, beverage, sports, leisure and entertainment goods and services.) directly to our Audiences. See Section 3.2 below regarding how to opt out of such information sharing.
Please note, however, that we do not knowingly disclose or sell any of the following (if and to the extent collected by us) to our Business Partners for their separate marketing and advertising purposes (except with your prior opt-in consent): credit card number, debit card number, bank account number, and other financial account information; Social Security numbers, or other government-issued identifiers; personal health and medical information; information about personal sexual behavior or orientation; information pertaining to children under the age of 13 at the time of collection; and information indicating the precise real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Sensitive Information").
In addition, from time to time, we may co-sponsor events and/or product/service offerings with third parties. If you participate in such co-sponsored events or offerings, any PII and UAI we collect from you based on your participation may be shared with our co-sponsors who may use such information for their own marketing and advertising purposes. YOU MUST CONTACT OUR CO-SPONSORS DIRECTLY IN ORDER TO OPT OUT OF THEIR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION FOR MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PURPOSES.
2.2.2 Disclosure to our Service Providers: We may disclose PII and UAI to our outside vendors and contractors who need to access such information in order to perform services (including, without limitation, transaction/payment processing, order fulfillment, contest/sweepstakes administration and prize fulfillment, data research and analysis, data collection and processing, data storage, data security, hosting and technical support for the Univision Interactive Network, and marketing and advertising support) for us (hereinafter referred to collectively as "our Service Providers"). Generally, we require that our Service Providers use your information shared by us solely for the purposes of performing services for us and that they maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information and not further disclose the information to others.
2.2.3 Disclosure under other circumstances: We may disclose PII and UAI to others if doing so is required by law or, in our good faith belief, is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with legal process (including a court order or subpoena); (2) cooperate with law enforcement; (3) enforce this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for the Univision Interactive Network; (4) respond to an emergency; or (5) protect the rights, property or safety of Univision, one or more members of our Audiences, and/or the public. In addition, we may transfer PII and UAI as part of our assets if we (or parts of our businesses) are, sold or transferred to, merged with, or acquired by, a third party. Upon such transfer, the privacy policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of your information.
2.2.4 Unrestricted disclosure of AAI: Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of AAI, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use, disclose, sell, or otherwise share such information. For example, we may freely share AAI with our Business Partners who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share AAI with our Service Providers in order for them to perform services to us.

5. Cookies & Similar Technologies
A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from an Internet server and stored in your computer or mobile device. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, collect UAI about your activities on the Univision Interactive Network, tailor our products and services to suit your personal interests, estimate our audience size, assist our online merchants to track visits to and sales at their stores and to process your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyze your visiting patterns.

These are small electronic images embedded in web content (including online ads) and email messages and are ordinarily not visible to users. Like cookies, Web Beacons enable us to track pages and content (including ads) accessed and viewed by users.

Web beacons in emails may recognize activities such as when an email was opened, how many times an email was forwarded, which links in the email were clicked on, etc. Web Beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page. However, Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.

6. Data Security
Protecting the security of your Personally Identifiable Information that you share with us is of the utmost importance to us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet or any mobile or wireless network and no data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from or within the Univision Interactive Network, and you do so at your own risk. By providing your email address to us (whether on the Univision Interactive Network or otherwise), you acknowledge and agree that we may notify you by email in the event of a breach of security involving your Personally Identifiable Information.
We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.

The Univision Interactive Network contains links to sites operated and maintained by third-parties, as well as links to products and services (including software) provided by third-parties. For example, the Univision Interactive Network may display third-party ads, and clicking on such ads will take you to the websites of those advertisers. We have no control whatsoever over such third-parties, their Internet sites, or their products or services. Once you enter a third-party site, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply, and any information collected from or about you on that third-party site will be governed by the privacy policies and practices of that third party. Third-party sites do not follow our Privacy Policy and their privacy practices may be substantially different from this Privacy Policy.
