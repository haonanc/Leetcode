Preventing Personal Identity Theft
Headlines tell us what we already suspected: identity theft is happening daily and it is affecting a large part of Florida's population. Recently published 2012 statistics revealed that Florida residents experienced more id theft than residents of any other US state. We all know identity theft is about stealing credit card information but did you know some criminals steal your identity to avoid arrest and capture by law enforcement? Some thieves steal your personal information to use your medical insurance, while others file fraudulent tax returns to illegally obtain tax refunds. To help you protect your personal information, the UF Privacy Office created a quick online training " Preventing Identity Theft " which is available here . Take a few minutes to discover how best to protect your information.
