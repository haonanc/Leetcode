- A majority of all used US imports have either been in accidents, been stolen, been flooded, salvaged and rebuilt and shipped to Europe or are subject to open recalls. CARFAX helps you identify hidden problems with imported used cars from the US so you don’t lose money. For 30 years, CARFAX has been collecting data on US vehicles from thousands of sources and has helped millions of used car shoppers reduce their risk of getting stuck with a vehicle that has costly hidden problems. If you are interested in a used US import, help protect yourself with a CARFAX Vehicle History Report from CARFAX Europe, the official CARFAX website in Europe and the only legal source for authentic CARFAX Vehicle History Reports.
- Welcome to CARFAX, the Vehicle History Expert for American Cars
- CARFAX is the most trusted source of vehicle history information about US cars. For more than 30 years, CARFAX has been helping millions of used car shoppers make better purchase decisions and avoid expensive hidden problems. In addition, CARFAX has helped used car dealers around the world to build trust with their customers and sell their American cars with confidence.
- With more than 14 billion records, CARFAX has built up its database with the help of its partners and sources, including government offices, law enforcement agencies, service and repair shops, car dealerships, insurance companies and many more.
- CARFAX’s vision is to change the used car market for the better. As an independent source which benefits both consumers and dealers, no US used car should be bought without looking into its history with the help of a CARFAX Vehicle History Report.
- What is a CARFAX Vehicle History Report?
- The CARFAX Vehicle History Report takes the billions of records on file, detailing all of the most important information about used cars from the United States and Canada, and assembles them into one easy to read report. There are several types of records included in the report, including:
- Vehicle accident check: Buying a second hand car which has been in an accident can lead to costly problems down the road. Our vehicle accident check informs potential buyers of any serious problems in the car’s history, including total loss.
- Vehicle mileage check: One of the most common forms of automotive fraud in the second hand car market relates to odometer manipulation. Our vehicle mileage check helps ensure buyers that no odometer rollbacks have occurred.
- Car ownership: It may seem difficult to know how an American car was used in the past. The CARFAX Vehicle History Report includes records on car ownership, including whether the car was ever used as a rental car or taxi.
- Car recalls: US import cars generally don’t carry the manufacturer guarantee protecting against recalls. This means any costs related to the repair of open car recalls fall onto the new owner. In some cases, car recalls set out to fix potentially dangerous manufacturing defects. The CARFAX Car History Report identifies any open recalls on US cars.
- Salvage Title: US cars may be given a salvage title when they are no longer roadworthy due to damage from an accident, flood or fire, or if they have been stolen. The CARFAX Vehicle History Report helps buyers stay away from salvage cars and avoid potential expenses in the future.
- Stolen car: Even if it seems unlikely, many stolen US cars make their way over to Europe. To avoid possible legal problems, it’s advisable to not buy a stolen car.
- Airbag deployment: Often times, serious accidents result in airbag deployment. The CARFAX Vehicle History Report will also notify shoppers of American cars whether or not the vehicle has experienced such a situation.
- Service car records: Buying used cars which have been well maintained can be a great advantage. Service car records are included in the CARFAX Vehicle History Report to give shoppers confidence when buying second hand cars.
