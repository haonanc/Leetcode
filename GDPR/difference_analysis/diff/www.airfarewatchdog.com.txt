We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options.  You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from Smarter Travel and its partners and enjoy other benefits of being a registered member.  For example, only registered members are able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, e-mail Airfarewatchdog content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes.  In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site.
+ Information from Other Sources.
+ We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you.  For example, if you visit Airfarewatchdog by "clicking-through" from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third-party services, such as social media services, through our Site or before coming to our Site, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services. We will work with our existing partners and potential future partners to improve and personalize your use of our Site in accordance with the practices outlined in this section and Policy.
+ Automatic Information.
+ We automatically collect some information from your computer or Device when you visit Airfarewatchdog.  For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring Web site.  We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited and searches and/or reservations facilitated or made.  One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of our users and customize your user experience.
+ Cookies and Other Web Technologies.
+ Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive or your Device (if your Web browser permits).  Airfarewatchdog and its affiliated websites and Apps use cookies for the following general purposes:
+ To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site.  For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit.  We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in."  Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
+ To help us customize the content, website experience, and advertisements provided to you on our Site and Apps and on other Web sites across the Internet.  For example, when you access a Web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.  See Display of Advertising/Your Choices for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.
+ To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).
+ This Site participates in exchanges of anonymous information about user browsing behavior on the Site. This non-personally identifiable information is collected by cookies and other similar technologies and segmented into different anonymized groups. We may share these types of anonymous information with third parties to facilitate the display of targeted advertisements. Please click here  or  here to learn more about these types of exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies and your options with regard to participation in these programs (including opting-out).
+ The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies.  Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.
+ Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page.  We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party Web site, and to improve site performance.  We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.  This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.
+ Display of Advertising/Your Choices
+ Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising
+ Airfarewatchdog and its affiliated websites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites.  To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches and other site activities, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests.  So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on Airfarewatchdog.com, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on Airfarewatchdog.com or on another website you visit.
+ We do not share your personal information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.  You can choose not to receive relevant online advertising on other Web sites, based on your travel-related searches on Airfarewatchdog.com by clicking here.
+ Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising
+ Many of the advertisements you see on the Smarter Travel family of sites are served by TripAdvisor or its service providers.  But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies .  These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different Web sites on the Internet.  The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.
+ Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.  Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative , which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.  To learn more, please click here .
+ Response to Do Not Track signals
+ Your Web browser may transmit a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal to Airfarewatchdog and other websites. Because of differences in Web browsers' default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. Airfarewatchdog does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and Airfarewatchdog recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach.
