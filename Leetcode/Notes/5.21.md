The use of Question mark(?) in c++:
e.g. l1 = l1 ? l1->next : nullptr;
? is called conditional operator and it has a format of X? Y1 : Y2. If X is true, it evaluates to Y1, if not, it evaluates to Y2.

Auto: a new C++ 11 feature; 
auto x works pretty much the same way as template type deduction works for function templates. Consider a function template like this:
template<class T>
int whatever(T t) { 
    // point A
};
At point A, a type has been assigned to T based on the value passed for the parameter to whatever. When you do auto x = some_expression;, essentially the same type deduction mechanism is used to determine the type for x from the type of some_expression that's used to initialize it.
Substring: inclusive both on the left and right
